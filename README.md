It's a super rough prototype, yep.

## Setup:
* Make sure you have XCode installed
* Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
* Install [bower](https://github.com/bower/bower)
```
$ npm install -g bower
  ```
(you may need to use sudo for all the npm installs)
* Install Yeoman
```
npm install -g yo
```
* Install Grunt
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
* Run 
```
npm install
``` 
and 
```
bower install
```
* Make sure you have Ruby installed, and run 
```gem install compass```

## Development
You may want to use the Yeoman [AngularJS Generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) to add files, etc.


## To run:
* Navigate to your project root
* Run command:
```
grunt serve
```
* Bam! an app!
